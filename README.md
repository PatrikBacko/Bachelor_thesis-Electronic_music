# Bachelor_thesis-Electronic_music
Bachelor thesis about electronic music. The goal of this theses is to create a neural network, which will be able to generate drum one-shot samples with emphasis on drum-type or genre of the sample.

Neural network will be trained on dataset with thousands of one-shots, which is also created by me, and can be found in this repository (data.md).
